**âš WARNING:** these notes were made by me in a academic way, they are in no way 100% reviewd or done by a professional, do not refer to them as a source, at all. Just figured I could share a bit of my journey to ones who mught be starting too :)

In this repository I have Notion pages with the notes I'm writing down about HTML, CSS and JS.
